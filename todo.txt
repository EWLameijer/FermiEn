As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.


Ideas
-start up in listview instead of studyview          140     15 /    560/u
-clean up code (check with Visser-site)             200     210     99/u
-probeer de plaatjes in de resources te krijgen     30      90      20/u
-check that all buttons work                        0               0
