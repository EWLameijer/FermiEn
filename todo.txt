// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines,
tabs, and so on.

subtask 1: refactoring: refactor fun String.toLines() [possibly make parser object?]
subtask 2: remove starting and ending "" in the toLines()

Subtask 1: make functionality to get question and answer from the user
Subtask 2: write the question and answer to a file


=> logical extension: make some kind of GUI/Form that enables me as user to change the default filename to read from/
write to
-> will also need a settings file to save that filename
