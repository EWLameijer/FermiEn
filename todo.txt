// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.



Feature: make replace card respond to R char
Bugfix: if you change priority, and then change the card, the new card should have the new priority, NOT the default priority

?? When applicable Bugfix: changing contents should NOT change priority of card
