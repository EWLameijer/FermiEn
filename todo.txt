// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

?When adding card: does it update the timer?
   TIMER IS FINE. Hypothesis: does not jump at the right time
        -either panel is informational and does not show button
        -or panel is reactive and does not work

        1) investigate if panel is informational or reactive. Then think of next plan.

!! BUG improving learning: how?
? bad reset of timer after deck swap?
!! BUG: make delete card work (Java concurrency in practice)
!!Feature: automatically save 3 most recent versions
!!Feature: auto-clean fourth save file
!!Feature: restore from save file

??Check if modify card while studying works well

BUG: if text in review window is large, it doesn't scroll?
