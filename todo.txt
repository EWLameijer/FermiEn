As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

1. ensure that reviews take place!
1) BUG: back to reviews -> SHOULD BE INFORMATION WINDOW, NOT REVIEWING WINDOW

2. load and save reviews so far
4. add way to change priority of card
5. make priorities affect repetition order
6. add analysis to optimize learning
7. implement way to import text files, including duplicate detection
8. add option to create/manage encyclopedias, like Eb has (Ctrl+1 etc.)

?check that it works correctly when opening new encyclopedias
?fill the notes with 100 CS entries, like #Haskell
?remove leading empty lines from entries? (toLines=> filter)
?text C# will like google look for separate terms?
?save entries in alphabetic order?
?give the window a non-standard Java icon?








=> logical extension: make some kind of GUI/Form that enables me as user to change the default filename to read from/
