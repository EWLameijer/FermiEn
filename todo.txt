// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

1. bug: if no reviews to do: do NOT open with review window!
4. add way to change priority of card
5. make priorities affect repetition order
6. add analysis to optimize learning
7. implement way to import text files, including duplicate detection
8. add option to create/manage encyclopedias, like Eb has (Ctrl+1 etc.)

?check that it works correctly when opening new encyclopedias
?fill the notes with 100 CS entries, like #Haskell
?remove leading empty lines from entries? (toLines=> filter)
?text C# will like google look for separate terms?
?save entries in alphabetic order?
?give the window a non-standard Java icon?
