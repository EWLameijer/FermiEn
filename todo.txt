// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.


Subtask 2: write the question and answer to a file
  make adding card impossible if it has same horizontal format in question

  when that works, let clicking on any item pop up the view/edit window
  // make search box (whole text search in q/a)



=> logical extension: make some kind of GUI/Form that enables me as user to change the default filename to read from/
write to
-> will also need a settings file to save that filename
