As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can

"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

1. ensure that reviews take place!
2. load and save reviews so far
4. add way to change priority of card
5. make priorities affect repetition order
6. add analysis to optimize learning
7. implement way to import text files, including duplicate detection
8. add option to create/manage encyclopedias, like Eb has (Ctrl+1 etc.)

?fill the notes with 100 CS entries, like #Haskell
?remove leading empty lines from entries? (toLines=> filter)

?save entries in alphabetic order?
?give the window a non-standard Java icon?
