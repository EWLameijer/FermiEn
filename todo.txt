// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

when adding an entry, immediately update the table in the main window

allow overwriting question or answer
fill the notes with 100 CS entries, like #Haskell
make escape clear the search field
make panel to switch to repetitions (and open FermiEn with it)
give priority to repetitions (1 archive; store as third argument)

?text C# will like google look for separate terms?
?save entries in alphabetic order?






=> logical extension: make some kind of GUI/Form that enables me as user to change the default filename to read from/
write to
-> will also need a settings file to save that filename
