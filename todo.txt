// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

Subtask 1: make functionality to get question and answer from the user
  SEE https://github.com/EWLameijer/Eb2/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/eb/subwindow/cardediting/CardEditingWindow.kt

Subtask 2: write the question and answer to a file

  Let THAT pop up a smaller edit window that works like the current main window
  When that works, repurpose the main window for a list of questions and answers, sorted alphabetically, \n replaced by " "
  when that works, let clicking on any item pop up the view/edit window



=> logical extension: make some kind of GUI/Form that enables me as user to change the default filename to read from/
write to
-> will also need a settings file to save that filename
