// design basic structure: context, question, answer, importance
?? importance for context


As learning works best with flashcards, which have a question and answer, a file format should be supported that can
house both questions and answers. Assuming text (for now) a normal format would be
"questionString"\t"answerString". Note that both questionString and answerString should be able to contain newlines and
backslashes.

BUG: if text in review window is large, it doesn't scroll?
!make replacement window friendlier in case of long strings...

? check that all buttons work
? print, read, clean up code
