Spaced repetition/private encyclopedia hybrid, inspired by the vast knowledge of Nobel-prize winning physicist
Enrico Fermi. He was one of the very few physicists after Newton who excelled in both experimental and theoretical physics,
 and was also called the "Pope of Physics" (because he was always right). Next to that, he was an impassioned and
 great educator, who educated several
young physicists who went on to win Nobel prizes themselves
 (depending on the count, 10, 11 or 12 prizes http://fermieffect.com/enrico-fermi/influence-in-science/).

But even Fermi did not get his knowledge for 'free'-he tended to spend train journeys reviewing elementary physics formulas,
it is likely that that process occasionally gave him a good idea and refreshed his mind.

FermiEn is similarly designed to help one expand, maintain and refresh one's knowledge.

The list panel, which is shown on startup (when there are no cards to be reviewed, or the "Start deck in review mode" 
in the study options window is unchecked) shows all entries in the current encyclopedia, sorted alphabetically.

The basic structure is that of an encyclopedia, where you make entries (Ctrl+N for a new entry) that contain both a
key (or question) and a description (or answer). Finding all entries that
refer to a certain string (like "Java") is easily done by using the search bar at the top.

The second mode of FermiEn is spaced repetition: you can rehearse your knowledge by clicking Ctrl+R.

Note that when studying for an exam it can be helpful to make a separate encyclopedia focused on that exam, Ctrl+O
("Control Oh") opens
(or creates) an encyclopedia. With Ctrl-0 ("Control Zero") you can easily make a shortcut to the new (or old) encyclopedia. After the exam,
you can merge the exam-encyclopedia using Ctrl+F.

Scientifically, studying so that about 85% of your repetitions are successful seems optimal; the default study settings
are borne from my own personal experiments with learning French, but over time FermiEn will adjust the study
scheme so you will get about 85% success, no matter how easy or hard the material is. If you want/need to change the
settings, especially when starting out with a new encyclopedia, use Ctrl+T to set things correctly. With Ctrl+T you
can also adjust whether you want to start up in reviewing/study mode or in list/encyclopedia mode.

If you want a certain tricky fact to crop up with priority, you can change its importance from the default value (1) to
a maximum of 10. This may be useful for important things that you tend to forget.

If you find bugs or have feature requests, please let me know via the Github Issues tab; you are also of course allowed
to clone the code to create a version that is suited to your particular needs and demands.
