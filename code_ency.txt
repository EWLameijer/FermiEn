General design

Model - view - controller

View: the Main window  and such

Controller: the main window is growing quite a bit

Model = the encyclopedia itself.


ReviewManager

tabs:
  note that IntelliJ automatically converts tabs to spaces in text files, so make text files in Notepad++
  I also decided not to use/permit tabs in questions and answers. It both simplifies coding and allows easier switching
    between question and answer window later.

unit testing: Example of parametrized test
  @ParameterizedTest(name = "{0} => {1}")
    @CsvSource(
        "2, 4",
        "3, 9",
        "-1, 1"
    )
    fun testForTesting(input: Int, expectedOutput: Int) {
        val actualOutput = forTesting(input)
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput) {
            "$input should lead to $expectedOutput, not $actualOutput."
        }
    }
